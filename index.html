                    <p> Greetings everyone, I am Suyash Singh. I am a sophomore studying Computer Science at Abdul Kalam Technical University. </p>

                    <p>
                        
                        <br>
                        I always had a keen interest in semiconductor devices and their internal workings. I haven't really coded in my life and just saw people afar writing these cool commands on terminal. Finally the oppurtunity has arrived and I would love to gain new programming skills and upskill myself everyday.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I am currently learning Python and look forward to get into the field of Data Analysis. Apart from this, I like to watch anime, play chess, learn new skills and meet new people.
                    </p>
